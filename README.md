# corelation_finance
First, install yfinance and pandas libraries.
The codes you need to write in the terminal are as follows:
pip install yfinance
pip install pandas

As a recommendation, first save it as an Excel file and interpret the values there. Next, write the data you want to compare as in the example comparison variable. You will find the correlation coefficient more accurate as a result of the tests you make, these parts are entirely up to individuals. After completing these, all you have to do is call the get_balance_rating function. Good luck :)
